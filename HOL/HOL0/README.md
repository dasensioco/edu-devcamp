## Exercise 1: Set up Office 365 Educational trial subscription<a name="ex1"></a>

1. Open a InPrivate or Incognito browser window (`Ctrl + Shift + P` in Edge and Internet Explorer and Firefox or `Ctrl + Shift + N` in Google Chrome)
 and browse to the signup page. Use this [promo code link](https://signup.microsoft.com/Signup?OfferId=03ee83a5-5cb4-4545-aca9-33ead43f222a,d764709a-7763-45ef-a2a8-db5b8b6ae704&DL=ENTERPRISEPREMIUM_FACULTY&ali=1) to set up an Educational trial subscription.

    ![image](./media/2018-06-27-16-27-00.jpg)

1. **Choose `United States`** for the Country/Region for your tenant (this determines the SDS Schema, and Datacenter deployment, **the sample data (below) does not work with all regions!**). Populate information about yourself and click `Next`.

    ![image](./media/2018-06-27-16-37-00.jpg)

1. Create a user name and password for your company and click `Create my account`.

    ![image](./media/2018-06-28-09-13-00.jpg)
    
1. Enter you phone number, select your method of communication and click `Text me`.

    ![image](./media/2018-06-28-09-16-00.jpg)

1. Once you receive your verification code, enter it and click `Next`.

    ![image](./media/2018-06-28-09-17-00.jpg)

1. Wait for the setup to finish. Prior to moving forward, make sure to capture the displayed information in order to sign into your new account. Click `You're ready to go...`.

    ![image](./media/2019-02-04-10-09-00.jpg)

    ![image](./media/2019-02-04-10-13-00.jpg)

1. You will be redirected to the verification page. Since verification requires you to edit the DNS records of your domain and take some time just close the browser tab and browse to [sds.microsoft.com](https://sds.microsoft.com/Home/Dashboard). (Please note that the link to the SDS admin page will not appear in the Office 365 Admin center while your domain is not verified). It may take a few minutes before you can access the SDS page.

    ![image](./media/2018-06-28-10-48-00.jpg)
	
1. If you are unable to sign in to School Data Sync, you probably don't have a license attached to your user account yet.

    ![image](./media/ex1-sds-no-license.png)

1. Go back to the [Office 365 Admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/) and click `Users` > `Active users` in the menu and select your user account. Click `Licenses and Apps`, scroll down and activate the `School Data Sync` app and click `Save changes`.

    ![image](./media/ex1-sds-activate-license.png)

1. Now you should be able to access the SDS page. Click `Show more` > `Admin` > `Admin centers` > `School Data Sync` again. If you are still unable to sign in to SDS, sign out of the Office 365 Admin center and sign back in to try again.

## Exercise 2: Set up demo data in the School Data Sync Admin Portal<a name="ex2"></a>

> Please note that if your Office 365 tenant is based in the UK, the required attributes for the CSV files containing the demo data will vary. For more detail go to [Required CSV files for School Data Sync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/schooldatasync/csv-files-for-school-data-sync#required-csv-files-for-school-data-sync). For the purpose of this course please do not select `United Kingdom` as `Country or region` during [Exercise 1: Set up Office 365 Educational trial subscription](https://github.com/Microsoft/edu-devcamp/tree/master/HOL/HOL0#exercise-1-set-up-office-365-educational-trial-subscription). Should you select UK anyway, go to [Required CSV files for School Data Sync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/schooldatasync/csv-files-for-school-data-sync#required-csv-files-for-school-data-sync) to download the CSV files in the UK format. The names of users and schools in your tenant will be different from those used in this training.

1. Download these CSV files containing the demo data: [School](./assets/School.csv), [Section](./assets/Section.csv), [Student](./assets/Student.csv), [Student Enrollment](./assets/StudentEnrollment.csv), [Teacher](./assets/Teacher.csv) and [Teacher Roster](./assets/TeacherRoster.csv). If you have downloaded the Dev Camp content you can find the files in the folder `HOL/HOL0/assets/`.

1. To access the School Data Sync Admin Portal launch a private web browser, navigate to [sds.microsoft.com](https://sds.microsoft.com), click `Sign-In`, then enter your O365 Global Admin account credentials.

1. After logging in, click `+ Add Profile` in the left hand navigation pane to create a `Sync Profile`.

    ![image](./media/2018-06-28-11-05-00.jpg)

1. On the `Choose Connection Type` page, complete the form. Enter a name for your sync profile. This name will be used to identify the sync profile in the SDS Dashboard, and cannot be changed once the profile setup is complete. Select `Upload CVS files` and `CVS files: SDS Format`. Once complete, click `Start`. 

    ![image](./media/2018-06-28-11-21-00.jpg)

1. On the Sync Options page, select the  `new users` option. Then click upload files to upload your 6 CSV files. Once uploaded, select an arbitrary stop date in the future, click `Next`. In a production scenario you would usually choose to sync existing users. For a more detailed instruction on the sync process see [docs.microsoft.com/en-us/SchoolDataSync/how-to-deploy-school-data-sync-by-using-csv-files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/SchoolDataSync/how-to-deploy-school-data-sync-by-using-csv-files).

    ![image](./media/2018-06-28-11-23-00.jpg)

1. On the `Teacher options` page make sure that `faculty` licenses are selected and click `Next`.

    ![image](./media/2018-06-28-11-25-00.jpg)

1. On the `Student options` page make sure that `student` licenses are selected and click `Next`.

    ![image](./media/2018-06-28-11-34-00.jpg)

1. On the `Review page`, ensure you've made the appropriate selections. If no additional changes are needed, click `Create Profile`.

    ![image](./media/2018-06-28-11-36-00.jpg)

1. Once you create a sync profile, SDS will begin a pre-sync validation process. During this process, SDS will ensure there are no obvious errors with your CSV files. If any errors are found during the pre-sync validation process, you will have the option to fix them and re-upload the files before clicking the resume sync button and begin the real synchronization process. If you receive errors and choose not to update them, you can still choose to resume sync without fixing the errors. Just be aware that SDS can only sustain up to 15,000 errors before the profile will enter a quarantine status.

    ![image](./media/2018-06-28-11-40-00.jpg)

    ![image](./media/2018-06-28-11-40-30.jpg)

1. The sync process will take some time and you will be prompted to manually refresh the status page. Press `F5` to do so.

    ![image](./media/2019-03-26-11-51-00.jpg)

1. Under `Subscription`, use your free trial. Also assign a name to your virtual machine and to the resource group that will be created along with the virtual machine. Enter your username and choose a password. Then click `Allow selected ports` and select `RDP` as the available inbound port. To continue, click `Management` at the top of the page.

    ![image](./media/2018-08-30-16-27-00.jpg)

    ![image](./media/2018-08-30-16-37-00.jpg)

1. While the virtual machine is provisioned you will see a notification in the top menu bar.

    ![image](./media/2018-08-30-16-39-00.jpg)

1. You will also see a notification when the provisioning process has finished.

    ![image](./media/2018-08-30-16-40-00.jpg)

1. Click `Virtual machines` in the menu on the left and click on the newly created virtual machine.

    ![image](./media/2018-08-30-16-42-00.jpg)

    ![image](./media/2018-08-30-16-50-00.jpg)

1. The exercises will prompt you to download several files. The pre-configured security settings do not allow downloads. Start the Internet Explorer. From the Tools menu, select `Internet Options`.

Your virtual machine is now ready to use.

>&#x1F53A; Even though you chose the `latest release` VM there might be new updates available for Visual Studio 2017 which are now released in very short intervals. It is **not** necessary and recommended to install these! The updates are usually quite large and the installation will take time! Only update if a version **lower than 15.7.0** is installed (check `Help` -> `About Microsoft Visual Studio`)! &#x1F53A;
