## Exercise 2: Set up demo data in the School Data Sync Admin Portal<a name="ex2"></a>

1. Download these CSV files containing the demo data: [School](./assests/School.csv), [Section](./assests/Section.csv), [Student](./assests/Student.csv), [Student Enrollment](./assests/StudentEnrollment.csv), [Teacher](./assests/Teacher.csv) and [Teacher Roster](./assests/TeacherRoster.csv). If you have downloaded the Dev Camp content you can find the files in the folder `HOL/HOL0/assets/`.

1. To access the School Data Sync Admin Portal launch a private web browser, navigate to [sds.microsoft.com](https://sds.microsoft.com), click `Sign-In`, then enter your O365 Global Admin account credentials.

1. After logging in, click `+ Add Profile` in the left hand navigation pane to create a `Sync Profile`.

    ![image](./media/2018-06-28-11-05-00.jpg)

1. On the `Choose Connection Type` page, complete the form. Enter a name for your sync profile. This name will be used to identify the sync profile in the SDS Dashboard, and cannot be changed once the profile setup is complete. Select `Upload CVS files` and `CVS files: SDS Format`. Once complete, click `Start`. 

    ![image](./media/2018-06-28-11-21-00.jpg)

1. On the Sync Options page, select the  `new users` option. Then click upload files to upload your 6 CSV files. Once uploaded, select an arbitrary stop date in the future, click `Next`. In a production scenario you would usually choose to sync existing users. For a more detailed instruction on the sync process see [docs.microsoft.com/en-us/SchoolDataSync/how-to-deploy-school-data-sync-by-using-csv-files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/SchoolDataSync/how-to-deploy-school-data-sync-by-using-csv-files).

    ![image](./media/2018-06-28-11-23-00.jpg)

1. On the `Teacher options` page click `Next`.

    ![image](./media/2018-06-28-11-25-00.jpg)

1. On the `Student options` page click `Next`.

    ![image](./media/2018-06-28-11-34-00.jpg)

1. On the `Review` page click `Next`.

    ![image](./media/2018-06-28-11-36-00.jpg)

1. On the `Review page`, ensure you've made the appropriate selections. If no additional changes are needed, click `Create Profile`. Once you create a sync profile, SDS will begin a pre-sync validation process. During this process, SDS will ensure there are no obvious errors with your CSV files. If any errors are found during the pre-sync validation process, you will have the option to fix them and re-upload the files before clicking the resume sync button and begin the real synchronization process. If you receive errors and choose not to update them, you can still choose to resume sync without fixing the errors. Just be aware that SDS can only sustain up to 15,000 errors before the profile will enter a quarantine status.

    ![image](./media/2018-06-28-11-40-30.jpg)

1. The sync process will take some time and you will be prompted to manually refresh the status page. Press `F5` to do so.

## Exercise 4: Provision a virtual machine for development<a name="ex4"></a>
To follow the programming examples in the upcoming hands-on labs you will need a machine running Microsoft Visual Studio. In this exercise you will provision a virtual machine in Azure that has Visual Studio 2017 already installed.

1. Open an InPrivate or Incognito browser window (`Ctrl + Shift + P` in Edge, Internet Explorer and Firefox or `Ctrl + Shift + N` in Google Chrome), browse to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in using the e-mail address used in the previous exercise.

    ![image](./media/2018-08-30-13-18-00.jpg)

1. Under `Subscription`, use your free trial. Also assign a name to your virtual machine and to the resource group that will be created along with the virtual machine. Enter your username and choose a password. Then select `RDP` as the available inbound port. To continue, click `Management` at the top of the page.

    ![image](./media/2018-08-30-16-27-00.jpg)

1. Disable all monitoring. Click `Review + create` at the bottom of the page.

    ![image](./media/2018-08-30-16-33-00.jpg)

1. Review the summary. Click `Create` at the bottom of the page.

    ![image](./media/2018-08-30-16-37-00.jpg)

1. While the virtual machine is provisioned you will see a notification in the top menu bar.

    ![image](./media/2018-08-30-16-39-00.jpg)

1. You will also see a notification when the provisioning process has finished.

    ![image](./media/2018-08-30-16-40-00.jpg)

1. Click `Virtual machines` in the menu on the left and click on the newly created virtual machine.

    ![image](./media/2018-08-30-16-42-00.jpg)

1. On the details page of the virtual machine click `Start` if it is not already running, then click `Connect`.

    ![image](./media/2018-08-30-16-43-00.jpg)

1. Use the `RDP` tab and click `Download RDP File`.

    ![image](./media/2018-08-30-16-45-00.jpg)

1. A remote desktop session will start. Enter the credentials you provided when setting up the virtual machine. Once you can see the desktop of Windows Server 2016 start Visual Studio 2017. Enter the credentials you used to create the Azure Free Trial to activate Visual Studio.

    ![image](./media/2018-08-30-16-50-00.jpg)

1. The exercises will prompt you to download several files. The pre-configured security settings do not allow downloads. Start the Internet Explorer. From the Tools menu, select `Internet Options`. In the Internet Options dialog box, click the `Security` tab. Click `Custom Level`. In the Security Settings dialog box, scroll to the `Downloads` section. Under `File download`, select `Enable`, and then click `OK`. In the confirmation dialog box, click `Yes`. Click `OK` > `Apply` > `OK`. If you want to debug web applications created in the hands-on labs you can download an alternative browser like [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

Your virtual machine is now ready to use.

>&#x1F53A; Even though you chose the `latest release` VM there might be new updates available for Visual Studio 2017 which are now released in very short intervals. It is **not** necessary and recommended to install these! The updates are usually quite large and the installation will take time! &#x1F53A;
